# Elektronica's Introduction to Arduino

## Getting Started 

### Basic Requirements

* Arduino IDE (That's it!) :wink:  
* Not quite. You'll need an Arduino Board and a USB cable too.
* You might also want some input-output devices such as sensors and LEDs too.

## Arduino

### What's an Arduino?
You can think of Arduino as a small computer which you can program to do small tasks. It can read inputs and control various external electronic/electrical components connected to it. In slightly more technical terms, it is a microcontroller.

The official [website](https://www.arduino.cc) says:
> Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It’s intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

For the philosophy behind Arduino watch this [video](https://www.ted.com/talks/massimo_banzi_how_arduino_is_open_sourcing_imagination).

### The IDE
For ease in programming the folks at Arduino have created an Integrated Development Environment. It can be used to write and upload programs to the board. The installation instructions can be found [here](0.Introduction/0.2-IDE.md).

### TinkerCAD
If you do not have access to an Arduino, plenty of options exist to emulate the basic functionality. The best and most popular among them is probably [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits). However, note that no emulator will reproduce real-life situations.
